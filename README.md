This solution sets it apart from competitors who might only focus on specific areas like IT support or knowledge retrieval within a single application.
* Moveworks is a platform that utilizes specialized technologies of machine learning models, including variants of the BERT language model, to automate and streamline support ticket processing. By analyzing historical support tickets, Moveworks' models can fulfill requests like answering policy questions, granting software access, or managing email groups. As of October 2021, it supports over 100 languages, providing a global reach.
A key feature of Moveworks' machine learning technology is the use of "Collective Learning." This concept addresses the challenge of "small data," where many companies lack sufficient internal datasets to train deep learning models effectively. By leveraging data across a wide range of companies, Moveworks can improve the accuracy of its predictions for resolving issues, even when a single organization may not have enough specific data. This shared learning approach allows Moveworks to deliver high-performance solutions, even for companies with relatively low volumes of support requests.
